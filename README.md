# Eyre

Automatic extraction of characters and locations from texts, using [named-entity recognition (NER)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named-entity_recognition) algorithms.

The name is temporary (after Jane Eyre).


## Goals

* Automatically gather list of characters and locations from different texts - might need to use connections to 'said', 'in', 'to the', 'went to', etc.
* Extract descriptions of characters and locations - use connections to 'is', 'was', 'looked like', etc.
* Show location of each occurence by position in text using inline graphs
* Combine information about characters, locations, and verbs to try to derive (very) rough plot outline
